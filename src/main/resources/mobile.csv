What is mobile data?
Mobile data is internet content delivered to mobile devices
such as smartphones and tablets over a wireless cellular connection.
Mobile data plans offer varying amounts of data transfer per month for a range of rates.

When users email, access webpages or use mobile apps,
their devices receive and transmit data from the internet.
In the absence of a local Wi-Fi connection, a mobile device usually connects via a subscription service with a cellular network provider. Consumers and business users often think of the meaning of mobile data in terms of cost and usage because mobile data is measured separately from voice calls and can increase monthly bills.

The increase in mobile users and the number of devices they own, as well as popularity of high-bandwidth
applications such as streaming video and video conferencing, is causing the amount of mobile data consumed
every year to climb. Telecommunications company Ericsson's annual Mobility Report, published in June 2021,
 estimated the monthly amount of global mobile data traffic at 49 exabytes. The report predicted that number
 will exceed 237 exabytes per month in 2026.
